# What's this?

A Haskell package containing additional examples for
[lens-aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-aeson). People who are not
yet very familiar with [lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) might
find it helpful.

# How to use this package?

Simply read the haddock documentation.

You can also play with the examples in the *repl*, by downloading the [Git
repo](https://github.com/danidiaz/lens-aeson-examples), building it, and
invoking

    $ cabal repl lens-aeson-examples
    Preprocessing library for lens-aeson-examples-1.0.0.0..
    GHCi, version 8.2.2: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help

    Ok, one module loaded.
    *Data.Aeson.Lens.Examples> pp Null -- we have Data.Aeson, Data.Aeson.Lens and Control.Lens in scope
    null

# How about an example for X?

Ideas for additional examples are welcome. Just open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/danidiaz/lens-aeson-examples).
